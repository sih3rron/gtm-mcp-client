# Overview

The Miro Value Conversation is a customer-led dialogue that uncovers current challenges (Before Scenario), clarifies their impact (Negative Consequences), explores a future state (After Scenario), and aligns on Positive Business Outcomes and the Required Capabilities to achieve them. Success is tracked via Metrics (Measurable Business Outcomes). We validate with Proof Points and position How We Do It / How We Do It Better.

Primary Value Drivers

Go to market faster with better quality

Reduce operational costs

Increase employee engagement

Conversation Flow & Guidance
1) Before Scenario

Purpose: Understand how work happens today: tools, workflows, stakeholders, handoffs.
Ask:

“Walk me through how planning → execution → review runs today.”

“Which tools do you use for workshops, planning, diagramming, and tracking? Where do handoffs drop?”

“What’s working well vs. where do things slow down?”
Coach: Map the end-to-end flow; confirm by restating.

2) Negative Consequences

Purpose: Expose tangible impact of the status quo (time, cost, risk, burnout, missed goals).
Ask:

“What happens when alignment breaks? Who feels it?”

“Where does tool sprawl or context switching create waste?”

“Any shadow IT/security/compliance concerns?”
Coach: Probe for frequency, scale, and examples. Tie to business objectives.

3) After Scenario

Purpose: Envision the desired future state once problems are solved.
Ask:

“If these issues vanished, how would your workflow change next quarter?”

“Which meetings could be async or shorter?”

“What would leadership see in a unified view?”
Coach: Anchor to specific workflows; identify early wins.

4) Positive Business Outcomes (PBOs)

Purpose: Prioritize Measurable Business Outcomes (no ROI modeling required).
Examples: faster time-to-market, fewer meetings, lower SaaS spend, reduced travel, higher adoption, more releases, improved eNPS.
Ask:

“Which business outcomes matter most for this initiative?”

“How would you describe success to your exec sponsor in one sentence?”

“What’s non-negotiable this quarter vs. next?”
Coach: Prioritize 2–3 outcomes; write them in customer language.

5) Required Capabilities

Purpose: Define the minimum capabilities needed to realize PBOs.
Examples: unified visual workspace; async & hybrid workshops; 2-way Jira/ADO; 130+ integrations; enterprise-grade security & governance (Enterprise Guard); admin scalability; reporting; accessibility; large-scale facilitation (Talktrack, Interactive Presentation Mode).
Ask:

“What capabilities must be in place to achieve those outcomes?”

“What does enterprise-grade security mean for you specifically?”

“What integrations are day-one critical vs. phase two?”
Coach: Map each outcome → capability; document “Phase 1 vs. later”.

6) Metrics (MBOs)

Purpose: Agree on how outcomes will be measured (leading + lagging).
Leading: meeting effectiveness, #async sessions, adoption, #integrations enabled.
Lagging: time-to-market, travel cost reduction, SaaS spend reduction, eNPS, productivity.
Ask:

“What baselines do you have today?”

“What cadence and who owns reporting?”

“What signals early wins in 30–60 days?”
Coach: Use existing exec dashboards; set thresholds.

7) How We Do It / How We Do It Better

Purpose: Explain Miro’s approach and differentiation, linked tightly to PBOs & capabilities.
Positioning hooks: single workspace across flows; deep dev-tool integrations; async/hybrid facilitation; AI (Miro Assist); Enterprise Guard; scale & performance; accessibility; breadth of integrations.

8) Proof Points

Purpose: Validate credibility with relevant stories, benchmarks, and third-party references.
Coach: Match by industry/outcomes/capabilities; offer customer connects when helpful.

Best-Practice Principles

Lead with outcomes → then capabilities.

Customer language over vendor speak.

Quantify where practical (measurable outcomes, not finance models).

Sequence quick wins → broader transformation.

Document agreements live (PBOs, capabilities, metrics, owners, cadence).

Common Pitfalls

Feature dumping before discovering outcomes.

Vague outcomes (e.g., “collaborate better”) with no measure.

Capabilities not mapped to outcomes.

Assuming ROI modeling when the customer wants MBOs.
