# Great Demo - Scoring Examples

## Overview
This document provides real-world scoring examples for the Great Demo framework. Use these examples to calibrate your scoring and understand what evidence supports different score ranges in demonstration scenarios.

## Component Scoring Examples

### 1. Situation Acknowledgment (Weight: 10%)

#### Excellent Example (Score: 9/10)
**Scenario**: Marketing automation demo for mid-market company

**Situation Setup**:
> **Rep**: "Before we dive into the demo, let me confirm what I heard in our discovery call. You're a 200-person B2B services company generating about 500 marketing qualified leads monthly, but only 8% are converting to opportunities. Your marketing team of 4 people is spending 20+ hours weekly on manual lead nurturing because your current system doesn't have workflow automation. Your sales team of 12 reps says they're getting leads that aren't properly qualified, and Marketing says Sales isn't following up quickly enough. Does that capture the key challenges we need to address today?"

**Customer Confirmation**:
> **Amanda Richardson (Marketing Director)**: "That's exactly right. And just this week, we lost a major prospect because they went three days without follow-up. Our reps didn't even know the lead had been assigned to them."

**Why This Scores Excellent**:
- Specific situational details recapped accurately
- Quantified context (200 people, 500 leads, 8% conversion, 20+ hours)
- Clear pain points articulated
- Customer validates the situation completely
- Recent specific example adds urgency

#### Poor Example (Score: 2/10)
**Scenario**: Same company, different approach

**Situation Setup**:
> **Rep**: "So you do marketing and sales, and you want to see our platform."

**Customer Response**:
> **Customer**: "Yes, show us what you've got."

**Why This Scores Low**:
- No specific situational acknowledgment
- Generic, vague setup
- No confirmation of understood needs
- Misses opportunity to establish context

---

### 2. Problem Illustration (Weight: 15%)

#### Good Example (Score: 7/10)
**Scenario**: Project management software demo

**Problem Illustration**:
> **Rep**: "Let me show you exactly what you described. Here's a typical project scenario - a 6-month software development initiative with 8 team members. Notice how in most systems, when the project manager wants to see status, they get either high-level dashboards that hide critical details, or overwhelming task lists that require clicking through dozens of items. Watch what happens when a developer marks a task complete but doesn't update the dependencies..."

> **Demo Action**: Shows project dashboard where completed task doesn't update timeline, creating confusion about project status.

**Customer Response**:
> **Tom Bradley (Project Manager)**: "That's exactly what happens to us! We had a client presentation last week where I thought we were on track, but the frontend work was actually blocked for three days."

**Why This Scores Well**:
- Demonstrates specific customer scenario
- Shows problem in context of their use case
- Customer relates immediately to the problem shown
- Connects to business consequence (client presentation issue)

#### Excellent Example (Score: 10/10)
**Scenario**: Financial planning software for wealth management firm

**Problem Illustration**:
> **Rep**: "You mentioned that client review meetings take 2+ hours because you're pulling data from 4 different systems. Let me recreate what Sarah, your senior advisor, experiences. It's Monday morning, and she has a client review at 10 AM for a $2.3 million portfolio. Watch the current process..."

> **Demo Sequence**: 
> 1. Shows logging into System A for account balances
> 2. Exports to Excel, manually calculates performance
> 3. Logs into System B for transaction history
> 4. Switches to System C for market data
> 5. Creates presentation slides manually
> 6. Shows clock: 47 minutes elapsed for prep work

**Customer Validation**:
> **Sarah Martinez (Senior Advisor)**: "You're watching me work! This is scary accurate. And you didn't even show the part where System B crashes and I have to start over."

**Business Impact Connection**:
> **Rep**: "So Sarah spends nearly an hour on prep work that should take 5 minutes. With 8 client meetings weekly, that's 6+ hours of administrative work instead of client-facing time. At $500/hour billing rate, that's $3,000 weekly in lost revenue opportunity."

**Customer Response**:
> **Mike Chen (Managing Partner)**: "Actually, it's worse than that because Sarah's our top producer. When she's doing admin work, she's not prospecting new clients."

**Why This Scores Excellent**:
- Specific, named persona (Sarah)
- Step-by-step recreation of current painful process
- Quantified time impact (47 minutes vs. 5 minutes needed)
- Customer validates accuracy enthusiastically
- Clear connection to revenue impact
- Customer adds additional business context

### 3. Solution Demonstration (Weight: 25%)

#### Fair Example (Score: 5/10)
**Scenario**: CRM platform demo

**Solution Demo**:
> **Rep**: "Here's our contact management module. You can see it has all the standard fields for customer information. You can add notes, track communications, and set follow-up reminders. The search function lets you find contacts by name or company."

**Customer Response**:
> **Customer**: "Okay, looks pretty standard."

**Why This Scores Fair**:
- Shows basic functionality
- Features-focused rather than outcome-focused
- No connection to specific customer needs
- Generic demonstration approach
- Minimal customer engagement

#### Excellent Example (Score: 9/10)
**Scenario**: Same CRM, different execution approach

**Solution Demo**:
> **Rep**: "Now let me show you how this solves your specific challenge. Remember, you mentioned that your sales reps are missing follow-ups because leads get buried in their email. Watch what happens when a new lead comes in from your website..."

> **Demo Flow**:
> 1. Shows lead capture from website form
> 2. Automatic lead scoring based on customer's criteria (company size, industry, budget indicated)
> 3. Instant assignment to appropriate rep with SMS notification
> 4. Automated follow-up sequence begins immediately
> 5. Dashboard shows lead status in real-time

**Customer Engagement**:
> **Lisa Wong (Sales Manager)**: "Wait, can you show that lead scoring part again? We get 50+ leads daily and our reps waste time on unqualified prospects."

**Rep Response**:
> **Rep**: "Absolutely. Based on your qualification criteria - companies with 100+ employees in manufacturing or technology with indicated budgets over $50K - watch how the system automatically prioritizes leads. Green means 'call immediately,' yellow means 'email sequence,' red means 'nurture campaign.'"

**Customer Validation**:
> **Lisa Wong**: "This would save our reps hours every day. They spend their mornings sorting through leads instead of making calls."

**Why This Scores Excellent**:
- Directly addresses stated customer problem
- Uses customer's specific qualification criteria
- Shows end-to-end process, not just features
- Customer asks for deeper exploration
- Clear business outcome connection (time savings for reps)
- Customer validates the value proposition

### 4. Value Realization (Weight: 25%)

#### Basic Example (Score: 4/10)
**Scenario**: Accounting software demo

**Value Discussion**:
> **Rep**: "Our customers typically see time savings and improved accuracy with our platform."

**Customer Response**:
> **Customer**: "That would be good for us."

**Why This Scores Low**:
- Vague, unspecific value claims
- No quantification or evidence
- Generic customer reference
- No validation or customer engagement

#### Excellent Example (Score: 10/10)
**Scenario**: Inventory management demo for retail chain

**Value Realization**:
> **Rep**: "Let's calculate the specific impact for your business. You mentioned stockouts cost you about $12,000 monthly in lost sales, and overstock ties up $200,000 in working capital. Our demand forecasting typically improves inventory accuracy by 35-40%. For your 47 locations, that means:"

> **Value Calculation**:
> - Reduced stockouts: $12,000 × 35% = $4,200 monthly savings ($50,400 annually)
> - Improved cash flow: $200,000 × 35% = $70,000 in freed working capital
> - Reduced carrying costs: $70,000 × 8% cost of capital = $5,600 annually
> - **Total Impact**: $56,000 annual savings + $70,000 freed capital

**Customer Engagement**:
> **Rachel Torres (Operations VP)**: "Those stockout numbers are actually conservative. During peak season, we probably lose $20,000 monthly. Can your system handle seasonal demand spikes?"

**Enhanced Value Discussion**:
> **Rep**: "Absolutely. Our seasonal modeling would be especially valuable for you. If we apply the 35% improvement to your peak season losses of $20,000 monthly for 3 months annually, that's an additional $21,000 in prevented losses."

**Customer ROI Validation**:
> **Rachel Torres**: "So we're looking at over $75,000 in annual impact, plus the working capital benefits. What's your implementation fee?"

**Rep**: "$45,000 for all 47 locations, including training and support."

**Customer Response**:
> **Rachel Torres**: "That's less than a 7-month payback. When can we start?"

**Why This Scores Excellent**:
- Specific calculations using customer's real numbers
- Multiple value streams identified and quantified
- Customer validates and expands on the value
- Clear ROI calculation with customer engagement
- Customer expresses buying intent based on value
- Concrete next steps discussion

### 5. Next Steps Confirmation (Weight: 15%)

#### Poor Example (Score: 2/10)
**Scenario**: End of software demo

**Next Steps**:
> **Rep**: "So, what do you think? Any questions about what we showed you today?"

**Customer Response**:
> **Customer**: "We need to think about it and get back to you."

**Why This Scores Low**:
- Vague, open-ended question
- No specific next steps proposed
- No commitment or timeline established
- Puts burden on customer to drive process

#### Excellent Example (Score: 9/10)
**Scenario**: End of comprehensive demo for HR platform

**Next Steps Confirmation**:
> **Rep**: "Based on what we've covered today, it sounds like our platform addresses your three main priorities: reducing time-to-hire from 45 to 25 days, improving candidate experience scores, and cutting recruiting costs by 30%. To move forward, I'd recommend three specific next steps:"

> **Proposed Action Plan**:
> 1. "Technical evaluation: I'll arrange for our solution architect to meet with your IT team next Tuesday to review integration requirements with your HRIS and ATS systems."
> 2. "Reference call: I'll connect you with Pacific Northwest Bank, who had a similar 300-person scaling challenge and saw 40% improvement in time-to-hire within 6 months."
> 3. "Pilot proposal: We'll prepare a 30-day pilot program for your Seattle office to demonstrate ROI before full rollout."

**Customer Engagement**:
> **Jennifer Park (HR Director)**: "That timeline works well. Our Q4 hiring push starts in 8 weeks, so we need to make a decision by month-end. Can you have the pilot proposal ready by Friday?"

**Rep Confirmation**:
> **Rep**: "Absolutely. I'll send the pilot proposal by Thursday, schedule the IT meeting for Tuesday at 2 PM, and set up the reference call for Wednesday. Does that sequence work for your timeline?"

**Customer Commitment**:
> **Jennifer Park**: "Perfect. I'll have our IT director available Tuesday, and I'll review the pilot proposal with our executive team on Friday. If the pilot goes well, we'd want to implement company-wide before Q4 hiring."

**Why This Scores Excellent**:
- Clear recap of key benefits and customer priorities
- Specific, actionable next steps proposed
- Multiple validation methods offered (technical review, reference, pilot)
- Customer provides clear timeline and decision criteria
- Mutual commitments established with specific dates
- Clear path to close established

- Situation Acknowledgment: 8 (strong recap of customer needs, confirmed)
- Problem Illustration: 9 (compelling recreation of current painful process)
- Solution Demonstration: 7 (good feature-to-benefit connection, some engagement)
- Value Realization: 6 (basic ROI discussed, customer interested but not deeply engaged)
- Next Steps: 8 (clear action plan, customer commits to timeline)

**Weighted Calculation**:
- Situation: 8 × 0.10 = 0.80
- Problem: 9 × 0.15 = 1.35
- Solution: 7 × 0.25 = 1.75
- Value: 6 × 0.25 = 1.50
- Next Steps: 8 × 0.15 = 1.20
- Objection Handling: 5 × 0.10 = 0.50

**Overall Score: 7.10**

## Great Demo Framework Pitfalls

### Common Over-Scoring Mistakes

1. **Crediting Feature Demonstrations Without Customer Confirmation**
   - ❌ Rep shows impressive feature = High solution score
   - ✅ Customer confirms feature solves their problem = High solution score

2. **Assuming Engagement Means Understanding**
   - ❌ Customer asks questions = High score
   - ✅ Customer asks specific, relevant questions that show comprehension = High score

3. **Confusing Demo Polish with Framework Execution**
   - ❌ Smooth, professional demo = High scores
   - ✅ Demo that follows Great Demo methodology and engages customer = High scores

### Common Under-Scoring Mistakes
