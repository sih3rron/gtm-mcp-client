Overview

Representative scoring examples (1–10 scale) to calibrate evaluators. Emphasis on PBOs and Required Capabilities; measurement framed as Measurable Business Outcomes, not ROI math.

1) Before Scenario (Weight: 10%)

Excellent (9/10)

VP Product: “Planning happens in Confluence, design in Figma, sprint rituals in Zoom+Miro, issues in Jira. Europe/US teams meet twice weekly just to re-sync. PMs copy data between tools for leadership updates.”
Why: Specific tools, cadence, cross-geo friction, leadership reporting. Clear baseline.

Poor (3/10)

Rep: “You use a few tools and have meetings, right?” — “Yes.”
Why: Vague, no flow or stakeholders captured.

2) Negative Consequences (10%)

Excellent (10/10)

CTO: “We slipped the last two releases by 3–4 weeks. We spend ~18 hrs/week in status meetings; travel for PI planning costs ~£70k/quarter. Security flagged ungoverned whiteboard tools.”
Why: Quantified delays, meeting load, travel cost, risk.

Fair (5/10)

“Meetings feel inefficient.”
Why: No business impact.

3) After Scenario (10%)

Good (8/10)

R&D Director: “We’d do quarterly PI planning hybrid, most stand-ups async, and give execs a single view of progress. Designers/PMs/engineers co-create in one place.”
Why: Practical future state; ties to alignment and hybrid.

Poor (2/10)

“It would be better.”
Why: Not actionable.

4) Positive Business Outcomes (25%)

Excellent (10/10)

CPO: “Top outcomes this half: cut time-to-market by 20%, reduce travel spend by 40%, and increase adoption of shared templates to 75% of squads.”
Why: Clear priorities + measurable targets.

Fair (5/10)

“We want to collaborate better.”
Why: Not measurable.

5) Required Capabilities (25%)

Excellent (9/10)

Head of Platforms: “We need a unified workspace; hybrid workshops with voting and private mode; 2-way Jira/ADO; enterprise-grade security (SSO, DLP, SCIM, data residency); admin analytics; accessibility; and guardrails for external collaborators.”
Why: Minimum, testable capabilities mapped to PBOs; enterprise specifics.

Poor (3/10)

“Cool features would be nice.”
Why: Unmapped, non-minimum.

6) Metrics / MBOs (10%)

Good (8/10)

PMO: “Baseline time-to-market is 24 weeks; we’ll target 19. Meetings average 22 hrs/pp/month; target 14 with increased meeting effectiveness scores. Track travel cost monthly and adoption by active boards/users.”
Why: Baselines, targets, cadence.

Poor (2/10)

“We’ll know it when we see it.”
Why: No measures.

7) Proof Points (10%)

Excellent (9/10)

Rep: “In auto manufacturing consortium X, hybrid PI planning saved >200 hours and ~$600k travel/quarter while strengthening security. Shall I connect you with their PMO lead?”
Why: Outcome-aligned, relevant, and offers reference.

Fair (5/10)

“Lots of big customers use us.”
Why: Generic.
