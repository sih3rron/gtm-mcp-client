Pre-Call (30–45 min)

Objectives: establish context, hypotheses, and a crisp call goal.

 Research company, initiatives, org map, tech stack, security posture.

 Identify likely PBOs by value driver (velocity, cost, engagement).

 Draft Required Capabilities hypotheses (unified workspace, async workshops, key integrations, governance).

 Prepare 3–5 questions for each stage (Before/Negative/After/PBO/Capabilities/Metrics).

 Select 1–2 Proof Points matched to industry & outcomes.

 Define success for this call (e.g., agree top 2 PBOs + initial capability list).

During Call (framework flow)

 Before Scenario: map current flow/tools/stakeholders.

 Negative Consequences: quantify business impact.

 After Scenario: co-create the target state.

 PBOs: prioritize 2–3 measurable outcomes in customer language.

 Required Capabilities: derive minimum capabilities for those outcomes; note Phase 1 vs. later.

 Metrics: baselines, targets, owners, cadence; identify early-win indicators.

 How We Do It / Better: position ONLY what maps to PBOs.

 Proof Points: validate with relevant stories or benchmarks.

 Agree next steps, stakeholders, and timeline.

Post-Call (24–48 hrs)

 Send recap: Before/After, PBOs, Required Capabilities, Metrics (baselines/targets/owners), agreed next steps & dates.

 Capture in CRM: stakeholders, priorities, metrics, decision process, risks.

 Plan enablement/demo tailored to PBOs/capabilities; assign owners.

Discovery Gap Scan

 Missing stakeholder views?

 Security/compliance specifics?

 Integration depth (e.g., 2-way ADO/Jira) and admin/governance requirements?

 Baselines for metrics?

 Procurement/infosec path?
